<CaseStudyBadge />

**Last year:**
* I read zero books.
* I never worked out.
* I didn't journal or reflect on my days at all.
* I was skinny my entire life and could never seem to put on weight.
* I spent 4+ hours a day doom-scrolling on my phone.

**Now:**
* I read 2 books a month (consistently).
* I have gained 5kgs of healthy weight.
* I worked out for exactly 57% of the year (I track the data).
* I journal every single day without missing a session.
* I cut my screen time down to under 1 hour of leisure use.

I just generally feel capable and disciplined. Obviously, I am not perfect now (still want to gain more weight and hit 75% workout consistency), but I made huge strides this year.

Yet **NONE** of these were my 2025 resolution. I had only one resolution this year, because rarely have I ever stuck to a complex plan, and I wanted to make it INCREDIBLY easy this year. So, what was that resolution?

**It was journaling for 5 minutes.**

## The Diderot Effect

I have journaled every single day this year and will continue to do the same in the future. At first, I did it in a notebook and then moved onto an app to remove friction. The reason is very similar to the **Diderot Effect**.

For those who don’t know, Diderot lived in the 1700s and was very poor. Then Catherine the Great offered to buy his library for a large sum of money. With this, he bought a new scarlet robe.

He loved the robe, but soon found that all of his other possessions looked drab in comparison to it. Slowly, he began replacing things in his house with higher-end items that would better match his robe. Before long, Diderot didn’t have any money left.

When we buy a nice item (or adopt a nice habit) that doesn’t match other items, we will start to replace the other items. A similar thing happened to me, only the end result was discipline.

## How Journaling Triggered the Effect

I made the resolution to journal, and was determined to keep it. Even if I remembered at 11:55 PM, I would open my app and write some thoughts on the day. I made it so there wasn’t an option. After a little over a month, I didn't dread it anymore. So, in my own eyes, I became something more: **I became someone who journals.**

Pretty soon, the content of my days looked pretty drab in comparison to my newfound identity. It is painful to write "I did nothing but scroll TikTok today" in a notebook seven days in a row.

At first, I just wanted something interesting to write about. So, instead of scrolling, I picked up a book. I realized that writing "I read 3 chapters of *The Way of Kings*" felt much better than writing "I watched Netflix." After a month, I became **Someone Who Reads** as well as Someone Who Journals.

These became a part of my identity, but my physical reality was looking bad in comparison to my mental stuff. Because I was now "Someone Who Has Discipline," skipping the gym felt wrong. I started going. I tracked it. I realized I was working out 57% of the days, which was infinitely better than 0%.

Being skinny my whole life, I realized my gym efforts were wasted if I didn't fuel them. My journal entries about "feeling weak" pushed me to research nutrition. I started eating with purpose. I have gained 5kgs so far.

## What Does This Mean For You?

Maybe other people can have a similar experience. If anything, you could make it your resolution to just **Journal** this upcoming year. Or pick a different, very easy resolution that you associate with people who have their lives together (like making your bed, or drinking 2L of water).

Even if you want to have other resolutions, just make *this one* the one you don’t have a choice but to stick to. Worse comes to worse, nothing else changes but you have a nice record of your year.

If journaling is something you want to start then I recommend starting with a notebook and then moving onto an app to reduce friction of having a notebook. I use an app called **Three Cells**, it's pretty good and minimalistic.

I know this sounds a little gimmicky, but it really worked for me.

**TL;DR:** The resolution was journaling. I changed everything else (reading, gym, weight gain) to become the type of person who *deserved* to be written about in that journal.
