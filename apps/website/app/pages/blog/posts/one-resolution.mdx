<CaseStudyBadge />

**Last year:**
* I read zero books.
* I never worked out.
* I didn't journal or reflect on my days at all.
* I was skinny my entire life and could never seem to put on weight.
* I spent 4+ hours a day doom-scrolling on my phone.

**Now:**
* I read 2 books a month (consistently).
* I have gained 5kgs of healthy weight.
* I worked out for exactly 57% of the year (I track the data).
* I journal every single day without missing a session.
* I cut my screen time down to under 1 hour of leisure use.

I feel capable and disciplined. I'm not perfect (I still want to hit 75% workout consistency), but I made huge strides this year.

Yet **NONE** of these were my 2025 resolution. I had only one resolution this year. I knew I wouldn't stick to a complex plan, so I wanted to make it incredibly easy.

My resolution? **Journal for 5 minutes.**

## The Diderot Effect

I've journaled every single day this year. At first, I used a notebook, then I moved to an app. The reason this one small habit changed everything is similar to the **Diderot Effect**.

Denis Diderot was a French philosopher in the 1700s. He was poor until Catherine the Great bought his library, giving him a small fortune. He used the money to buy a beautiful scarlet robe.

He loved the robe, but he soon noticed that all his other possessions looked old and shabby next to it. Slowly, he started replacing his furniture, his rugs, and his art to match the quality of the robe. Before long, he had upgraded his entire life.

When we adopt a "high-quality" habit, it often highlights the "low-quality" parts of our lives. We start to upgrade our other behaviors to match the new standard. That's exactly what happened to me.

## How Journaling Triggered the Effect

I made a resolution to journal, and I was determined to keep it. Even if I remembered at 11:55 PM, I would open my app and write. After a month, I didn't dread it anymore. In my own eyes, I became **Someone Who Journals.**

Pretty soon, the content of my days looked pretty drab compared to my new identity. It's painful to write "I did nothing but scroll TikTok today" in a journal seven days in a row.

Reference points matter. So, to have something interesting to write about, I picked up a book. Writing "I read 3 chapters of *The Way of Kings*" felt much better than writing "I watched Netflix." After a month, I became **Someone Who Reads** too.

These habits became part of my identity. Because I was now "Someone With Discipline," skipping the gym felt wrong. So I started going. I tracked it. I realized I was working out 57% of the days, which was infinitely better than 0%.

My journal entries about "feeling weak" pushed me to look at my diet. I started eating with purpose. I gained 5kgs.

## What Does This Mean For You?

Maybe this can work for you too. If you're looking for a resolution, try just **Journaling**. Or pick one simple habit that you associate with "having your life together" (like making your bed or drinking water).

Make *this one thing* non-negotiable. Worst case, nothing else changes, but you have a nice record of your year.

If you want to start, I recommend just using your phone. I use **Three Cells** to keep it simple and friction-free.

I know it sounds like a hack, but it really worked for me. I changed my entire routine just so I'd have something good to write about at the end of the day.
