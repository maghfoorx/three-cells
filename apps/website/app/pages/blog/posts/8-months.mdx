I always thought journaling was a waste of time. Or at least, a massive hassle. The idea of sitting down every night to write "Dear Diary" just didn't appeal to me. It felt like too much work for very little payoff.
 
I had tried standard journaling before—the long, narrative daily entries—and always quit after a week. The blank page felt like a chore, not a tool.

Then, earlier this year, I saw an interview with Jim Collins (the author of *Good to Great*). He mentioned that he's been tracking his days for years. But his method wasn't about writing pages of thoughts. It was shockingly simple.

## The -2 to +2 Rule

Collins' system isn't about deep prose or analyzing your feelings. It's about data. He tracks his days by simply describing what he did and then rating them on a scale from **-2 to +2**.

| Score | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **+2** | Absolutely Fantastic Day |
| **+1** | Good Day / Successful |
| **0** | Neutral / Average Day |
| **-1** | Bad Day / Frustrating |
| **-2** | Terrible Day / Disaster |

I thought, *okay, I can do this.* So, each day I just jotted down what I did and gave it a score.

## From Guessing to Knowing

After a couple of months, this simple habit actually changed me. I wasn't just recording the days; I started seeing patterns. My days stopped being random events.

### 1. The Recipe for a Good Day

Now I can see exactly what my best days look like. By looking back at every **+2** and **+1** day, I found a clear recipe for my own happiness:

* **Working out:** Always happened on good days.
* **Deep Work:** A solid block of focused time.
* **Social Connection:** Intentional time with friends or family.
* **Rest:** At least 7 hours of sleep.

Before, I lived my days doing things I *thought* were good for me. Now I actually **know** what makes me happy. I'm pretty sure I'll have a happy life if I just stick to the things in my +2 column.

### 2. Spotting the Bad Habits

On the flip side, reviewing the **-1** and **-2** days showed me my triggers. Bad days almost always involved too much screen time, no exercise, or bad sleep. Seeing this data helped me catch myself before a bad day turned into a bad week.

## Removing Friction

I've built this habit now, and I don't plan on stopping. But to stay consistent, I had to make it easy.

I started with a notebook, which was great for momentum. But eventually, I started forgetting it, or it was just annoying to carry around.

To make it even easier, I moved to a dedicated tool. I use **Three Cells**. It has a mobile app and a web version, so I can log my day in seconds. The instant visual feedback (like the heatmap) makes it satisfying to keep the streak going.

## Conclusion

If you're like me—skeptical about journaling—I promise you, this method is different. You don't need to write a memoir. You just need to collect simple data points on your life.

Stop guessing what makes you happy and start tracking it. This simple, 5-minute audit turned self-improvement from a vague idea into a real process for me.
