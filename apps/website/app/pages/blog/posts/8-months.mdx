I've been into self-improvement and wellness for quite a long time, but always thought journaling was something that wasn't very useful. Or, worse, that it takes too long every day to write for a bit. There was too much friction for me, and honestly, I didn't believe in the process enough to get started.

I had tried standard journaling—the long, narrative daily entry—and always stalled out after a week. The blank page felt like a chore, not a tool.

Then, at the start of this year, I came across the author Jim Collins (known for books like *Good to Great*). He rarely does interviews, but in one, he talks about how he has been tracking how his days go for years. The method he described was shockingly simple.

## The Game-Changing 5-Minute System: The -2 to +2 Rule

Collins's system is not about deep prose or analyzing your feelings; it's about simple data collection. He tracks his days by simply describing what he did and then rating it from **-2 to +2**.

| Score | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **+2** | Absolutely Fantastic Day |
| **+1** | Good Day / Successful |
| **0** | Neutral / Average Day |
| **-1** | Bad Day / Frustrating |
| **-2** | Terrible Day / Disaster |

I thought, *okay, this doesn't sound very hard, let me try it.* So, each day I just described what I did, kept it short, and assigned a rating.

## The Shift: From Guessing to Knowing

After a couple of months, this simple habit actually changed me. I wasn't just recording the days; I was analyzing them. My days stopped being random events and started revealing powerful, repeatable patterns.

### 1. Identifying the "Best Day" Recipe

Now I'm able to see exactly what my best days look like and what my worst days look like. By looking back at every **+2** and **+1** day, I identified a clear, actionable recipe for happiness:

* **Working out:** Always present on the best days.
* **Deep Work:** A designated block of focused time.
* **Social Connection:** Spending intentional time with family or friends.
* **Rest:** Getting a good amount of sleep (7+ hours).

Whereas before I would just live my days doing things I *thought* were good for me, now I actually **know** what makes me happy. I'm pretty sure I will have a happy life if I just try to live each day doing the things from my +2 column.

### 2. Spotting the Rough Periods

Conversely, reviewing the **-1** and **-2** days showed clear triggers for rough patches—usually, prolonged screen time, lack of movement, or poor sleep consistency. Over the months, I can now see exactly when my rough periods were and what my best periods were, allowing me to take corrective action sooner.

## Reducing Friction: Tools for Consistency

I'm pretty sure I've built this habit well now, and it's not going to stop anytime soon. However, consistency required removing friction.

I started with a notebook at first, which was great for the initial momentum. But as the months went on, I found myself forgetting the notebook, or it was inconvenient to quickly input a thought on the go.

To reduce friction further, I moved to a dedicated tool. I use an app called **Three Cells**. It has both a mobile app and a web version, which made the daily rating and tracking process seamless. The instant visual feedback (like a heatmap) and the ease of assigning a score without having to open a complex spreadsheet was the key to hitting the eight-month streak.

## Conclusion: Your Happiest Life is Data-Driven

If you are like me—someone who was unsure about journaling before—I promise you, it can actually change your life. You don't need to write a memoir every night; you just need to start collecting simple data points on what truly moves your needle.

Stop guessing what makes you happy and start tracking it. This simple, 5-minute audit of my days turned self-improvement from a theoretical pursuit into a data-driven process.
