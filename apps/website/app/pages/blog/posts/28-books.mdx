I’ve been into self-improvement for a long time, and "reading more" was always on my list. But I was never consistent. I’d buy a stack of books, read three chapters of one, get bored, and then let them collect dust for the rest of the year. I wanted the identity of a "reader," but I didn't have the habits to back it up.

Last November, I decided to make reading a non-negotiable. I set a goal of AT LEAST 2 books a month. I just hit my 12-month mark and I've consumed **28 BOOKS**.

It's an amazing feeling to be this consistent with a goal I wanted for so long. Looking back, there were specific changes I made that took me from "wishing I read" to actually doing it.

## 1. Ignore the "Must-Read" Lists

I used to force myself to read dense non-fiction or "smart" books because I heard other people say they were "good" or essential for growth. That was a mistake. It made reading feel like homework.

The biggest shift happened when I gave myself permission to only read stuff that genuinely interested *me*. If I wasn't hooked in the first 50 pages, I dropped it. Reading became entertainment again, not a chore.

## 2. The Fiction/Non-Fiction Swap

To keep things fresh, I stopped trying to grind through back-to-back productivity books. I started alternating: one non-fiction book, followed by one fiction book.

This kept me from burning out on information overload. The fiction books acted as a palate cleanser, making me excited to jump back into non-fiction afterward. I've loved the *Dune* and *Stormlight Archive* series.

## 3. Replacing Music with Audiobooks

This was the tactical game-changer. I realised I had "dead time" during my commute and my workouts where I was just listening to the same playlists on Spotify.

I deleted Spotify and got an Audible subscription. Now, my drive to work and my time at the gym are my dedicated reading hours. I realised that "reading" doesn't always mean sitting in a quiet chair with a cup of tea; it just means consuming the book.

## 4. The 10 Minute Rule & Keeping a Streak

I stopped trying to find "perfect" times to read for an hour. Instead, I made a deal with myself: read for at least **10 minutes** before bed. No matter how tired I was.

Usually, 10 minutes turned into 30, but on bad days, I stopped at 10. The secret here was using a simple habit tracker. Seeing that daily progress on a visual counter was highly motivating.

I used the **Three Cells App**, which is a minimal habit tracker and journal. The app's heatmap visualisation helped me focus on keeping the streak alive. The habit has become so strong that I don't even think about reading before bed. It's just the default thing I do.

## Conclusion

Now, I actually feel like a reader. I’ve learned more this year than in the last five combined, simply because I stopped trying to do it "perfectly" and started doing it in a way that fit my life.

If you are like me, someone who buys books but never finishes them, try swapping your genres and killing your "should read" list. It made all the difference for me.
