I always wanted to be a "reader." You know the type—someone who Breezes through books and actually remembers what they read. But for years, I was just a book buyer. I'd pick up something interesting, read three chapters, get bored, and let it collect dust on my nightstand.

Last November, I decided to change that. I set a goal to read at least two books a month. Twelve months later, I've finished **28 books**.

It feels great to finally be consistent. Looking back, I didn't need more willpower. I just needed to change how I approached reading.

## 1. Ignore the "Must-Read" Lists

I used to force myself to read dense non-fiction or "smart" books because I thought I should. That was a mistake. It made reading feel like homework.

The biggest shift happened when I gave myself permission to only read things that genuinely interested *me*. If I wasn't hooked in the first 50 pages, I dropped it. Reading became entertainment again, not a chore.

## 2. The Fiction/Non-Fiction Swap

To keep things fresh, I stopped trying to grind through back-to-back productivity books. I started alternating: one non-fiction book, followed by one fiction book.

This kept me from burning out. The fiction books acted as a palate cleanser, making me excited to jump back into non-fiction afterward. I've loved the *Dune* and *Stormlight Archive* series.

## 3. Replacing Music with Audiobooks

This was the tactical game-changer. I realized I had so much "dead time" during my commute and gym sessions where I was just listening to the same old playlists.

I swapped Spotify for Audible. Now, my drive to work and my time at the gym are my dedicated reading hours. I realized that "reading" doesn't always mean sitting in a quiet chair with a tea; listening counts too.

## 4. The 10 Minute Rule

I stopped waiting for the perfect time to read for an hour. Instead, I made a deal with myself: read for at least **10 minutes** before bed. No matter how tired I was.

Usually, 10 minutes turned into 30. But on bad days, I stopped at 10. The secret was tracking it.

I used the **Three Cells App** to keep myself honest. Seeing that daily streak on the heatmap kept me going on days I wanted to skip. Now, reading before bed is just something I do automatically.

## Conclusion

Now, I actually feel like a reader. I’ve learned more this year than in the last five combined, simply because I stopped trying to do it "perfectly" and started doing it in a way that fit my life.

If you are like me and buy books but never finish them, try swapping your genres and ignoring the "smart" books. It made all the difference for me.
