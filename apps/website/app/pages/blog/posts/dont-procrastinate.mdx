Have you ever had the experience "I will do xyz at this time." Then for some reason you don't do it at that time, and you feel guilty? "Well ... I missed my opportunity, but tomorrow, I'll do it. Fresh start."

Sometimes it's important to remember that it's not a crime to end up doing something later than you intended on that day. You don't have to guilt trip yourself into following an absolutely rigid schedule where failure to adhere to the schedule means you feel like you have to wait until the next day before you try again.

Sometimes you have the motivation on that day later than expected, and that's okay, you should seize that moment. Over time you'll get better at doing stuff at the "right" time. But for now, it's okay to do stuff at the wrong time.

To give an example of what this post means. If you have depression for example, or you had a really bad sleep, there might be things expected of you in the morning that you don't have the motivation to do. Like brushing your teeth. But if for some reason you're ready to go brush your teeth at 4pm, seize the moment. It's not too late just because you didn't have the energy to do it in the morning. Don't listen to the voice that says, "well, I was supposed to do it in the morning, so it's too late and there's no point."

This can even apply in reverse. When you do something you weren't supposed to do, according to your goals. E.g say you ate a chocolate bar when it's not your cheat day. You might tell yourself "well ... I might as well eat whatever I want for today since I already ruined my healthy food only day." But it is okay to think "I ate junk food on a day where I just want to eat healthy. But I can eat healthy for the rest of the day. I don't have to give up, just because I'm not perfect and this day wasn't perfect.
