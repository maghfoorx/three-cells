I can change your entire mindset on journaling in just a few minutes.

As someone who has actively started to improve himself, I can tell you whole heartedly that journaling is an entire area of skill development on its own.


The guys who try..
Journaling is a keystone habit. Forget any of the other habits for a moment, focus on what I'm about to tell you. This clicked for me pretty hard and if I can help make this concept click for you, then this script is absolutely worth it.

Any and every person on planet Earth can benefit from journaling. Journaling has many different facets, many different techniques and philosophy behind its many methods.

A lot of people get confused when it comes to journaling. Either, they know the absolute basics, or they try more complex methods and get absolutely nowhere.

Guy 1 tries to do some gratitude journaling. After a few days, he gives up, not feeling gratitude for anything.

Guy number 2 tries to jump straight into journaling to solve his traumatic issues. He doesn’t understand why he cannot write down any meaningful thoughts, and thus gives up after just 2 days.

Guy number 3, the person we want to be, journals daily. He knows what questions to ask, targets the correct areas, then solves the problem through deep introspective thinking and writing his findings down on paper.

these guys, and perhaps you too, fall short because you are wired to instant gratification activities. You like instant pleasure, you crave it, so anything that is difficult and does not offer immediate reward, you put down. That's why you stop eating healthy after a week. Its why you cannot bring yourself to read that book or study for that test. You know it is wrong and you feel stuck, yet you indulge. That lack of progress makes you feel so much worse, and then to top the cycle off, you indulge in instant gratification activities to make yourself feel better.

This is a trap that hundreds of millions of us are stuck in. Literally.


Lower instant pleasures for the bigger reward
In order to make journaling work for you, you must spend no more than a couple hours per day on instant gratification activities. You need to give your brain a break. Your brain needs to re-wire and begin to feel good doing hard work again. This, in combination of turning off all of your devices for the majority of the day, or only using them to make significant progress in your life, will reset your brain. This will reset your brain after months. it WILL take months though - I personally have only just started noticing the changes after reducing my internet usage by about 70%.

After reducing internet usage, you want to increase your capacity for delaying gratification. Here is how you can start through journaling.


### Gratitude journaling

#### Character Design

Gratitude journaling
Gratitude journaling is a fairly simple yet brilliant concept. Every day, you just spend 10-15 minutes sitting in silence with your journal, writing down the first 5 or so things you feel grateful for. Write down a thing you’re grateful for.

For me, I am grateful for the table in my room. This might sound trivial, but that is the whole point. You don’t need to pick big, grandiose entities to feel grateful for. This can be literally anything that has given you a return of investment of which you feel good about. My table allows me to put my monitor, mousepad, mouse and desk lamp on without having to cramp myself up. I have plenty of space to put drinks on or write in my journal. a lot of desks are quite small and cramped, yet this one was just sitting in the downstairs living room of the shared accommodation I rent, just untouched. It has truly never let me down.

Look how big my entry is, all for a wooden table nobody would think twice about. This is gratitude - a feel good appreciation for anything and everything that gives you a return on investment.

Character Design
I am officially trademarking this - everybody call this Character Design! lol

This form of journaling is all about designing your ideal self. It is not a question of “Who am I right now”, but “Who am I in my ideal world”.

A lot of people scathe over the importance of Character Design. The new meta is to “Focus on the 1% improvements, as small improvements overtime make all the difference.” Although I agree that this is true, you cannot deny the sheer benefit of having both inspiration and clear-cut goals. Having those long-term goals and that daily story to motivate you is going to give you the drive to get up and do hard work.

I for example, am writing this right now, thinking about my future self. I dream of a massive following of men and woman who can grow and build off of my preaching's. I want to live a lifestyle of constant self improvement - I want to eat clean, chisel my body in the house of iron. I want to reset my brain fully to love the hard work.

Since this Character Design, I have already started making progress in areas of my life. I am at no stretch there, I have barely started. I however have keystone habits in my belt that are part of my character. I will carry these throughout life with me because they are who I want to be in an ideal world. I want ultimate calm, so I will meditate. I want to work through my problems, so I will journal. I want to build an audience of guys on self improvement, so I will live the lifestyle. I want a better life, so I will build the audience. This all takes time, but you can be absolutely sure that I will do it. that is the power character Design grants you - the vision of your ideal self and the drive to stay on the path.


Let me know how these techniques work for you. Never try to quash yourself thinking that because you've spend 15 minutes journaling, you've written enough. It is almost never enough. You can dig very deep into these habits - you're literally designing the one life you have on this planet, DO NOT take this time for granted.
